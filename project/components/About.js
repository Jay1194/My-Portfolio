              <p>I'm a 21-year-old Canadian native who recently relocated to the United States after receiving my green card. My journey into programming began as a hobby, driven by a passion for creating clean and efficient code. Last year, I earned a certificate from the SMU Coding Bootcamp, where I honed my skills in writing code that not only meets but exceeds client expectations. I thrive on the challenge of shipping features on time while maintaining a high standard of quality. As I continue to grow in this dynamic field, I am eager to contribute my expertise to innovative projects that push boundaries and deliver impactful solutions. </p>
